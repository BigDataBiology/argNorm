card~~~tetU~~~U01917.1:412-730~~~tetracycline Tetracycline-resistant determinant encoded on the plasmid pKQ10 in Enterococcus faecium	3004650	Previously mapped to ARO: 3002907 (vanE) by RGI
card~~~SHV-53~~~AY590467:0-729~~~carbapenem;cephalosporin;penam SHV-53 is a beta-lactamase that has been found in clinical isolates	3001110	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo and the current CARD both get the gene from AY590467. However, it seems that the NCBI record has an extra 'T' in the beginning ('tattatctcc') while CARD has corrected this to 'ATTATCTC...'
card~~~LEN-4~~~AY130287:0-823~~~penam;penem LEN-4 is a beta-lactamase found in Escherichia coli	3002472	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo and the current CARD both get the gene from AY130287. However, it seems that the NCBI record has an extra 'T' in the beginning ('TGTTATCTCCCT�') while CARD has corrected this to 'GTTATCTCC...'
card~~~LEN-3~~~AY130286:0-823~~~penam;penem LEN-3 is a beta-lactamase. From the Pasteur Institute list of LEN beta-lactamases	3002475	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo and the current CARD both get the gene from AY130286. However, it seems that the NCBI record has an extra 'T' in the beginning ('TGTTATCTCCC') while CARD has corrected this to 'GTTATCTCCC...'
card~~~TEM-199~~~JX050178:0-853~~~cephalosporin;monobactam;penam;penem TEM-199 is a beta-lactamase	3001058	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo and the current CARD both get the gene from JX050178. However, it seems that the NCBI record has an extra 'T' in the beginning ('TCAACATTTCC�') while CARD has corrected this to 'CAACATTTCC...'
card~~~LEN-14~~~AY265889:0-460~~~penam;penem LEN-14 is a beta-lactamase. From the Pasteur Institute list of LEN beta-lactamases	3002477	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo and the current CARD both get the gene from AY265889. However, it seems that the NCBI record is from (nucleotide) index 0->460 while CARD uses 3->458
card~~~QnrS3~~~EU077611:0-656~~~fluoroquinolone QnrS3 is a plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance protein found in Escherichia coli	3002792	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo and the current CARD both get the gene from EU077611. However, it seems that the NCBI record is from (nucleotide) index 0->656 while CARD uses 3->656
card~~~mphB~~~AE005174.2:3397370-3397847~~~macrolide The mphB gene encodes for MPH(2')-II. This enzymes phosphorylates 14-membered and 16-membered macrolides.  It phosphorylates macrolides in GTP- dependent manner at 2'-OH hydroxyl of desosamine sugar of macrolides	3000318	RGI had skipped this gene during mapping. The fna file from abricate's github repo obtains the gene from: AE005174, while CARD obtains the gene from: D85892
