# Resfinder Notes

## Gene Clusters

- Resfinder has gene clusters (nucleotide sequence with multiple CDSs present) which can't be passed through RGI using 'contig' mode.
- Gene clusters were identified and were manually assigned ARO numbers.
- 40 gene clusters present.

- 9 genes in reverse complement form also present.
- RC genes were manually curated

# NCBI Notes

NCBI also has stress response genes and virulence genes not covered by CARD. This is the reason for the missing mappings in NCBI curation.
