def: "A relationship ontology term in which the subject (e.g. a gene family) confers or contributes to antibiotic resistance to the object (e.g. a drug class). It is a qualitative measure of antibiotic resistance, based on an experiment illustrating elevated MIC even outside of a clinical setting. A family of AMR genes confers resistance to a class of antibiotics if and only if all instances of that family confer resistance to some instances of that class in a pathogen." []

An entity is resistant to a chemical compound if and only if x is a pathogen and y is an antibiotic, and the fitness of that pathogen is not decreased when exposed to that antibiotic." []
