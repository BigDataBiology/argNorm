Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the ESBL phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to b-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid.  Although the inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of E. coli, but also some strains of K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, P. mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii. Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid and sulbactam, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam-lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin/sulbactam, they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, although resistance has been described."

The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime." [PMID:24696435, PMID:16891520]

def: "Cephaloridine is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, first-generation cephalosporin with antibacterial activity. Cephaloridine binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis." [PMID:2907014, PMID:5175748]

Moreover a 45 amino-acid substitution at position 29 of AxyZ (V29G) was identified in a clinical Achromobacter strain that occurred during the course of chronic respiratory tract colonization in a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. This substitution, also detected in 3 other strains exposed in vitro to tobramycin, led to the increase in axyY transcription level (5 to 17-fold) together with the increase in antibiotic resistance level."

However, horizontal gene transfer among gut microbes could create harmful antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Lokesh et al. analyzed Bifidobacterium antitubercular drug resistance and mutations in rpoB. They found that B. animalis, B. longum and B. adolescentis showed considerable resistance to pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and streptomycin, while B. adolescentis had mutations both in the rifampicin (RIF) pocket and in regions outside the pockets, and also showed considerable resistance to RIF."

This is used for programmatic and compatibility purposes and is not ontologically relevant.

If the original gene name is less than 15 characters, the CARD short name is identical; if the gene name is greater than 15 characters, the CARD Short Name has been abbreviated by CARD curators specifically to identify the proper gene or protein name. All CARD Short Names are unique and have whitespace characters replaced by underscore characters. The convention for pathogen names is capitalized first letter of the genus followed by the lowercase first three letters of the species name. The antibiotic abbreviations are from https://journals.asm.org/journal/aac/abbreviations plus some custom abbreviations by the CARD curators. Simple CARD Short Names often do not involve either, e.g. CTX-M-15, but where applicable the CARD Short Names follow pathogen_gene or pathogen_gene_drug.

def: "Gram staining is a method for staining and identifying bacteria. It is based on the differential retention of a crystal violet-iodine complex within the cell membrane. The cell wall of gram-positive cells have a thick peptidoglycan layer that retains crystal violet after an alcohol wash (staining black-blue or purple by a counterstain). The cell wall of gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer that does not retain crystal violet after an alcohol wash (staining red after counterstain). Some cells have variable staining in culture (e.g. Bacillus, Clostridium) while others have indeterminate staining due to unique aspects of their cell membrane or wall (e.g. Mycobacterium, Mycoplasma)."

The TB community instead developed a likelihood framework, based on statistical association of SNVs with observed phenotypic resistance across a large number of sequenced genomes, organized as mutation catalogs. It is important to note that each catalog may recycle data from earlier catalogs." []
